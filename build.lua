-- Bundle and modules ------------------------------------------------------
-- Note: It is intended to release the previous hacks as standalone
--       packages. Therefore, there is only a fake bundle, although
--       changes to the individual packages may also result in changes
--       to the scrhack package and may therefore require a new release
--       of scrhack.

modules = { "scrhack",
	    "floatbytocbasic",
	    "floatrowbytocbasic",
	    "listingsbytocbasic",
            "lscapeenhanced" }

-- Packaging for and upload to CTAN ----------------------------------------
