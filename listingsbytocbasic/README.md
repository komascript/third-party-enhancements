# Abstract

For several years
[KOMA-Script](https://www.sourceforge.net/project/koma-script) provided a
package `scrhack`, that has been made not only to improve the compatibility of
third-party packages with KOMA-Script classes, but also to generally improve
third-party packages. The package consisted not only in the package file
`scrhack.sty` but also in several so called hacks as separate files with
extension `.hak`. In the course of splitting off former KOMA-Script packages
from the KOMA-Script collection, it was decided to create independent packages
from the individual hacks. These new independent packages then serve as
replacements for the original packages they were intended to improve. Package
`listingsbytocbasic` was intended to be such an enhancement package. It
provides additional features of using package
[`tocbasic`](https://ctan.org/pkg/tocbasic) by patching package
[`listings`](https://ctan.org/pkg/float). But thanks to Jobst Hoffmann's
willingness to integrate the complete functionality into the package
[`listings`](https://ctan.org/pkg/listings), this work was withdrawn
before the first release.
